A React front-end with a Java Spring Boot backend (REST API) for an Inventory application. Allows for displaying, deleting, editing, and creating inventory items. Also adds a location feature where locations for inventory items can be created and assigned to specific inventory items. 

If cloning from GitHub, make sure you run 'npm install' inside of the frontend folder after cloning.

To run:
1. Go into the 'backend' folder and enter "sudo mvn spring-boot:run" if on Mac, or just mvn spring-boot:run.
2. Open a separate terminal, cd into 'frontend', and run 'npm start'.

In Replit: go to http://localhost:3001 in the Firefox window that is opened to see the running app once the .replit script is finished running.
